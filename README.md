# Python Deep Dive Part 2 Project 6

### Cooperative Multitasking Using Coroutines:

- Coroutine Based Data Processing Pipeline:
    - [x] Concurrency at every stage of the data processing pipeline...

    - [x] Process any number of files, of any length, for any number of filters

    - [x] Multitask across all input files, broadcasting every row concurrently

    - [x] Evaluate each row against any number of filters per input file
    
    - [x] Dynamic data type inference and concurrent data parsing

    - [x] Robust error handling of potentially unclean input data

    - [x] Multiple date formats supported via user defined format key library

    - [x] Generate user defined named tuples classes for each row processed
    
    - [x] Multi-file output supports custom output directory and file names

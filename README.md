### Cooperative Multitasking Using Coroutines:

- Coroutines Based Data Processing Pipeline:
    - [x] handle any number of files for any amount of filters

    - [x] multitask across all input files, processing every row concurrently

    - [x] evaluate each row against any number of user defined filters per file
    
    - [x] dynamically infer data types and parse data concurrently

    - [x] handle multiple date formats from a user defined format library

    - [x] generate user defined named tuples for each file type for rich
     comparisons
    
    - [x] output data into user defined directory and csv tables

    - [x] robust error handling accounts for potential unclean data samples
